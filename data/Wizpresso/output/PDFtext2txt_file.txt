BUSINESS AND STRATEGIC UPDATES   
Core commerce 
China Retail Marketplaces – comprehensive product supply and engaging user experience drive 
consumer growth and higher purchase frequency 
Consumers  
In December 2020, our China retail marketplaces ha d 902 million mobile MAUs. Annual active consumers 
on our China retail marketplaces was 779 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, representing a quarterly net increase of 22 million. We continue to grow consumer mindshare and wallet 
share among our users, as reflected in higher purchase frequency from all city tiers. 
We continued to increase penetration in less deve loped areas, reflecting our success in broadening product 
offering to meet diverse demand.  One of the key drivers of our acquisition of new users and consumers in 
less developed areas is Taobao Deals (
特价版 ).  During the quarter, Taobao Deals achieved rapid user growth 
by continuing to expand its value-for-money product supply and focusing on user acquisition initiatives.  
Annual active consumers of Taobao Deals reached over 100 million for the twelve months period ended 
December 31, 2020 and mobile MAUs of Taobao Deal s also reached over 100 million in December 2020. 
Product Supply  
Tmall online physical goods GMV , excluding unpaid orders, grew 19% year-over-year during the December 
2020 quarter, supported primarily by rapid growth of the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) and home 
furnishing categories, while growth of the consumer electronics category accelerated year-over-year.  The year-over-year growth rate of Taobao online physi cal goods GMV , excluding unpaid orders, was robust for 
the December 2020 quarter, primarily driven by solid growth of the apparel and accessories, home 
furnishing and consumer electronics categories. 
 
We celebrated the twelfth annual 11.11 Global Shopping Festival in the quarter, featuring a number of key changes in order to better serve brands and enhance c onsumer experience.  We extended what originally was 
a one-day festival occurring on November 11 to 11 days, running from November 1 through November 11, 
2020. This change created greater opportunities for merchants and brands to increase sales and build engagement and relationships with their customers. The extended festival also enhanced the overall 
shopping experience of consumers by reducing pressu re on logistics demand and ensuring timely order 
delivery. The new approach yielded strong results, attracting a total of over 250,000 brands and 5 million 
merchants and generating RMB498.2 billion (US$74.1 bi llion) in GMV , excluding unpaid orders, during the 
11-day campaign, an increase of 26% compared to the same timeframe in 2019.  Over 470 brands achieved more than RMB100 million in sales, showcasing the virtuous cycle effects of digital transformation across our ecosystem.  The shopping festival was also an opportunity for brands to launch new products and build 
brand awareness.  During the festival this year, th ere were approximately 30 million new product launches 
and GMV , excluding unpaid orders, for new products grew strongly by 35% year-over-year.     
 
 
 
3 
 
  Tmall Global is the premier platform through which international brands and merchants enter the China 
market online and build brand awareness.  The number of brands and merchants on the Tmall Global 
platform as of December 31, 2020 grew over 60% year-over-year.  In order to better connect international 
brands with Chinese consumers, Tmall Global continued to innovate in its cross-border logistics solutions.  
Brands that do not have a physical presence in China can now store inventory in our warehouses located in 
their home markets, and Tmall Global facilitates export to China when orders are placed.  This service leverages the capabilities and economies of scale of Alibaba’s logistics infrastructure to enable brands to 
quickly enter the China market while reducing sales uncertainty and controlling costs. Purchases of products 
warehoused and shipped from overseas by Tmall Global grew rapidly, achieving triple-digit year-over-year 
growth in GMV, excluding unpaid orders, during the December quarter.  
Engagement  
During the December quarter, we introduced the Follow  (
订阅) and Entertain  (逛逛) features on the front-
page of the Taobao app, which further improved user engagement with brands, merchants, key opinion 
leaders (KOLs), vloggers and content creators.   On the Follow  landing page, consumers can view new 
products and promotions offered by the stores they follow or in which they have memberships.  This feature 
is an effective method to enhance consumer loyalty with quality merchants and brands.  By browsing the Entertain  channel, consumers can learn about the latest consumption and lifestyle trends as well as follow 
their favorite KOLs, vloggers and content creators.  During the quarter, page views enabled through Taobao 
front page recommendations grew str ongly by over 90% year-over-year.  
Taobao Live is an indispensable branding, marketing a nd distribution tool that allows consumers to directly 
interact with brands, merchants and KOLs through livestreaming sessions.  Our own businesses, such as 
Juhuasuan, Ele.me and Fliggy, are also increasingly leveraging Taobao Live to attract and engage with 
consumers.  Taobao Live generated over RMB400 billion in GMV for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.  
New Retail – gaining market share in the grocer y category using multi-banner and multi-format 
strategy 
In October 2020, we completed our acquisition of a co ntrolling stake in Sun Art Retail Group Limited (“Sun 
Art”), a leading hypermarket operator in China, and st arted consolidating Sun Art’s results in our financial 
statements.  The increased investment in Sun Art will allow us to digitalize its offline traffic, synchronize 
online and offline channel inventory, broaden supply ch ain network and increase online purchases.  In the 
quarter ended December 31, 2020, online purchases, a majority of which was driven by Alibaba’s digital 
technology, represented 24% of Sun Art’s sales of goods.  
 
Our self-operated grocery retail chain Freshippo (known  as “Hema” in Chinese) achieved healthy double-
digit same-store sales growth during the quarter as we  continued to optimize its product supply and improve 
customer experience. As of December 31, 2020, we self-operated 246 Freshippo stores in China.  Freshippo will continue to adopt a multi-format and multi-banner expansion strategy by developing new shopping 
formats and scenarios for consumption of food and beve rage and general merchandise.  During the quarter, 
Freshippo opened its first “X Membership” warehouse store in Shanghai, which features high-quality 
products at competitive prices that can be purchased only by store members.  
Local Consumer Services – fast and high-qua lity growth of merchants and consumers 
 
Demand for digitalization in the restaurant and servi ce industry remains strong after the impact of the 
COVID-19 pandemic in China. Ele.me has continued to capture this market opportunity, attracting high-
quality merchants by providing digital technology solutions and other value-added services.  The number of 
registered merchants grew over 30% year-over-year as of December 31, 2020. 
 
 
 
4 
 
   
Ele.me’s average daily number of paying members in the December quarter grew about 30% year-over-year 
given the successful upgrade of our membership  program and continued onboarding of high-quality 
merchants.  As part of our New Retail strategy, Ele.me  continues to expand its on-demand delivery services 
to cover a wider range of products in categories such as fresh produce and grocery.  As of December 31, 
2020, the number of non-restaurant registered merchants enabled by Ele.me increased by over 80% year-over-year.   
 Cainiao Network – improving efficiency across th e Alibaba ecosystem and the logistics industry in 
China and internationally 
 
In the December quarter, Cainiao Network revenue  grew 51% year-over-year to RMB11,360 million 
(US$1,741 million), primarily due to the increase in vo lume of orders fulfilled from our fast growing cross-
border and international commerce retail businesses.  Cainiao had positive operating cash flow during the 
quarter. 
 Cainiao Network continued to expand both its domestic services and global smart logistics infrastructure by 
deepening integration with logistics partners as well as offering more products and services.  In China, 
Cainiao and its partners processed over 2.3 billion orders during the 11.11 Global Shopping Festival while 
continuing to improve delivery time to enhance consumer experience.  Internationally, Cainiao and its 
partners continued to invest in smart logistics infrastructure to serve our global merchants and to help alleviate logistics capacity constraints caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  In December 2020, Cainiao 
deployed more than 200 international chartered cargo flights for our AliExpress business, which resulted in 
improved fulfilment efficiency for AliExpress orders a nd a reduction of average delivery time by 3.5 days 
for order deliveries from Chin a to international markets. 
 
International – consistent strong growth in Sout heast Asia and growth recovery of AliExpress 
Lazada  – Our Southeast Asian e-commerce platform Lazada continued to achieve robust growth in both 
buyers and sellers, benefiting from acceleration of digita lization across industries in Southeast Asia.  Lazada 
recorded another quarter of triple-digit year-over-ye ar order growth despite new waves of the COVID-19 
pandemic in many markets where it operates.   
AliExpress – Despite logistics disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in many markets where it 
operates, AliExpress, in partnership with Cainiao, continued to invest and upgrade its global logistics 
infrastructure to enhance its cross-border delivery capabilities and efficiency.  These investments have supported an ongoing growth recovery since the trough in the March 2020 quarter.  Excluding the Russia 
joint venture business, growth in GMV, excluding unpaid orders, has recovered to a pre-COVID pandemic 
level in the December quarter.  
Cloud Computing 
Alibaba Cloud empowers the digital transformation of enterprises by providing comprehensive technology 
solutions and services in the cloud for a wide range of industries.  In the December quarter, cloud computing 
revenue grew 50% year-over-year to RMB16,115 milli on (US$2,470 million), primarily driven by robust 
growth in revenue from customers in the Internet a nd retail industries and the public sector.  For the first 
time, Alibaba Cloud achieved positive adjusted EBIT A during the quarter due to the realization of 
economies of scale.  
During the 11.11 Global Shopping Festival, Alibaba Cloud provided a highly scalable, reliable and secure 
public cloud infrastructure, which at its peak processed 583,000 orders per second.  Since we migrated our 
e-commerce businesses onto the public cloud a year ago, these businesses are now able to seamlessly create, 
 
 
 
5 
 
  upgrade and deploy on a cloud native approach; and this  capability was especially important during the 
festival, helping us to improve operating efficiency and ensure business continuity. 
Alibaba Cloud continues to invest in research and development of leading cloud technologies to help our 
customers undertake digital transformation and enable the growth of their businesses.  Our proprietary 
technologies have consistently won recognition from l eading research and advisory organizations such as 
Gartner and Forrester. For example, according to Ga rtner’s November 2020 report, among the large-scale 
global cloud providers, Alibaba Cloud is the only Chinese company with the Leader  ranking for database 
management system under Gartner’s Magic Quadrant measurement.  
Digital Media and Entertainment 
Youku maintained its strong focus on providing a superior user experience and blockbuster content in a wide 
range of genres.  During the quarter, Youku’s average daily subscriber base increased around 30% year-
over-year, driven by the appeal of its original content and continued contribution from the 88VIP 
membership program.  
 
Alibaba Pictures continued its solid track record in content investment and distribution. For example, Alibaba Pictures invested in and distributed the top three grossing films during the three-day New Year 
holiday in China, which accounted for over 80% of China box office sales during the period according to 
Beacon Box Office data. Alibaba Pictures’ popular original dramas, such as Professional Single , also 
contributed to Youku’s strong subscription growth during the quarter. In addition, Alibaba Pictures 
enhanced the production capabilities of popular original  dramas that are exclusively featured on Youku and 
increased IP commercialization by content owners on our online marketplaces.  
 
We continued to improve the operational efficiency of our digital media and entertainment businesses 
through disciplined investment in content and produc tion capability. During the quarter, adjusted EBITA 
loss for the digital media and entertai nment segment narrowed year-over-year. 
 
Cash Flow from Operating Activities and Free Cash Flow  
In the December 2020 quarter, net cash provided by operating activities was RMB103,208 million 
(US$15,817 million), an increase of 7% compared to RMB96,505 million in the same quarter of 2019. Free 
cash flow, a non-GAAP measurement of liquidity, increased by 23% to RMB96,210 million (US$14,745 million), from RMB78,279 million in the same quarter of 2019, mainly due to our robust profit growth. A 
reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activitie s to free cash flow is included at the end of this 
results announcement. 
Share Repurchase 
On December 28, 2020, we announced that our board of directors authorized an upsize of our share 
repurchase program from US$6 billion to US$10 billion, for a two-year period through the end of 2022. 
During the quarter ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased approximately 540,000 of our ADSs (or 
approximately 4.3 million of our ordinary shares ) for approximately US$118 million under the share 
repurchase program. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 21.7 billion ordinary shares (equivalent to approximately 2.71 billion ADSs) issued and outstanding. 
Anti-monopoly Investigation 
On December 24, 2020, Alibaba Group received a notice of an investigation from the State Administration 
for Market Regulation (“SAMR”) that it had commenced an investigation pursuant to the PRC Anti-
monopoly Law.  The investigation is ongoing and we are fully cooperating with the SAMR.  We have 
established a special taskforce with leaders from our relevant business units to conduct internal reviews. We 
 
 
 
6 
 
  will continue to actively communicate with the SAMR on compliance with regulatory requirements. We will 
further update the market when the investigation is concluded. 
Update on Ant Group 
On November 3, 2020, Ant Group announced the suspensi on of its proposed dual lis tings and initial public 
offering on the Shanghai Stock Exchange STAR board and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Due to recent significant changes in the Fintech regulatory environment in China, Ant Group is in the process of 
developing its rectification plan, which will need to go through the relevant regulatory procedures. 
Therefore, Ant Group’s business prospects and IPO plans are subject to substantial uncertainties. Currently, 
we are unable to make a complete and fair assessment of the impact that these changes and uncertainties will 
have on Alibaba Group. We will update the market once Ant Group has completed the relevant regulatory procedures for its rectification plan.

RMB153,679 million (US$23,552 million), an increas e of 39% compared to RMB110,458 million in 
the same quarter of 2019. Customer management revenue grew 20% year-over-year, primarily due to

contributions from our direct sales businesses, including Tmall Supermarket and Freshippo. 
The proportion of revenue from our direct sales busi nesses increased this quarter after we began to 
consolidate Sun Art in October 2020. We expect th at the proportion of revenue of our direct sales 
businesses will continue to increase as we further implement our New Retail strategy.

RMB3,831 million (US$587 million), an increase of  14% compared to RMB3,365 million in the

paying members and the number of paying members on 1688.com.

paying members and average revenue from paying members on Alibaba.com, as well as an increase in revenue generated by cross-border related value-added services. 
 Cainiao logistics services   
Revenue from Cainiao Network’s logistics services, which represents revenue from its domestic and 
international one-stop-shop logistics services and supply chain management solutions, after

quarter ended December 31, 2020, an increase of  51% compared to RMB7,518 million in the same 
quarter of 2019, primarily due to the increase in volume of orders fulfilled from our fast growing

31, 2020, an increase of 10% compared to RMB7,584  million in the same quarter of 2019, primarily

RMB8,079 million (US$1,238 million), an increase of 1% compared to RMB8,028 million in the same quarter of 2019. The slight increase was primarily due to the increase in revenue from online games 
business, largely offset by the decrease in revenue from customer management. 
Innovation initiatives and others 
Revenue from innovation initiatives and others in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 was RMB1,349 
million (US$207 million), an increase of 9% compared to RMB1,232 million in the same quarter of 2019.

(US$18,585 million), or 55% of revenue, compared to RMB84,332 million, or 52% of revenue, in the same 
quarter of 2019. Without the effect of share-based compen sation expense, cost of revenue as a percentage of 
revenue would have increased from 51% in the quarter ended December 31, 2019 to 54% in the quarter 
ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily at tributable to higher proportion of our direct sales 
businesses from the consolidation of Sun Art as well as the growth of our Tmall Supermarket and New Retail businesses, which resulted in increased cost of inventory, partly offset by a decrease in delivery costs 
per order of our local consumer services and a de crease in content costs of our digital media and 
entertainment segment.

  Product development expenses –  Product development expenses in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 
were RMB13,607 million (US$2,086 million), or 6% of  revenue, compared to RMB11,077 million, or 7% 
of revenue, in the same quarter of 2019. Without the effect of share-based compensation expense, product

December 31, 2019 to 4% in the quarter ended December 31, 2020.  
Sales and marketing expenses – Sales and marketing expenses in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 
were RMB25,343 million (US$3,884 million), or 11% of  revenue, compared to RMB15,800 million, or 9% 
of revenue, in the same quarter of 2019. Without the effect of share-based compensation expense, sales and 
marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue w ould have increased from 9% in the quarter ended 
December 31, 2019 to 11% in the quarter ended December 31, 2020.  The increase was primarily due to an 
increase in marketing and promotional spending fo r user acquisition and retention on our China retail

quarter compared to the previous quarter.

  Share-based compensation expense related to Ant Gro up share-based awards decreased in this quarter 
compared to the previous quarter, mainly due to the re cognition of an increase in the value of these awards 
in the previous quarter.  
We expect that our share-based compensation expense wi ll continue to be affected by changes in the fair 
value of the underlying awards and the quantity of awards we grant in the future.  
Amortization of intangible assets –  Amortization of intangible assets in the quarter ended December 31, 
2020 was RMB3,172 million (US$486 million), a decreas e of 3% from RMB3,272 million in the same 
quarter of 2019.  
Income from operations and operating margin 
Income from operations in the quarter ended D ecember 31, 2020 was RMB 49,002 million (US$7,510

moved beyond the incubation stage. This reclassification conforms to the way that we manage and monitor segment performance. Comparative figures were reclassified to conform to this presentation. 
 
Core commerce segment – Adjusted  EBITA increased by 15% to RMB66,637 million (US$10,213 
million) in the quarter ended December 31, 2020, comp ared to RMB58,075 million in the same quarter of 
2019, primarily due to an increase in marketplace-based core commerce adjusted EBITA as well as reduced 
losses for local consumer services business. Marketplace-based core commerce adjusted EBITA increased 10% year-over-year to RMB73,327 million (US$11,238 million). The growth rate of marketplace-based 
 
 
 
15 
 
  core commerce adjusted EBITA has been decreasing b ecause of our increased strategic investments in 
certain new businesses within China retail marketplaces.  Our investments in new business initiatives within 
China retail marketplaces, such as Taobao Deals, Ta obao Live, Taobao Short Video and Taobao Grocery, 
will expand our addressable market in China by enhancing consumer experience and loyalty and increasing 
penetration into less developed areas.  
Adjusted EBITA margin decreased from 41% in the quarter ended December 31, 2019 to 34% in the quarter 
ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to the consolidation of Sun Art and the increased revenue 
contribution from our self-operated New Retail and direct  sales businesses, in respect of which revenue is 
recorded on a gross basis, including the cost of inventory. 
A reconciliation of adjusted EBITA for core commerce to marketplace-based core commerce adjusted 
EBITA is included at the end of this results announcement. 
We expect that our core commerce adjusted EBITA margin  will continue to be affected by the pace of our 
investment in new businesses and the growth of our se lf-operated New Retail and direct sales businesses. 
Cloud computing segment –  Adjusted EBITA of RMB24 million (US$3 million) in the quarter ended 
December 31, 2020 was profitable for the first time, co mpared to a loss of RMB356 million in the same 
quarter of 2019, primarily attributable to the realization of economies of scale. 
Digital media and entertainment segment –  Adjusted EBITA in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 was 
a loss of RMB1,389 million (US$213 million), compared to a loss of RMB3,400 million in the same quarter 
of 2019. Adjusted EBITA margin improved to negative 17% in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 from negative 42% in the quarter ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to reduced losses in Youku and 
increased contribution from our online games business. 
Innovation initiatives and others segment – Adjusted EBITA in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 was 
a loss of RMB1,992 million (US$305 million), compared to a loss of RMB1,768 million in the same quarter 
of 2019, mainly due to our investments in technological research and innovation. 
Interest and investment income, net  
Interest and investment income, net in the quar ter ended December 31, 2020 was RMB40,036 million 
(US$6,135 million), an increase from RMB17,136 milli on in the same quarter of 2019. The increase is 
primarily due to an increase in the net gain arisin g from increases in the market prices of our equity 
investments in publicly-traded companies in the quarter ended December 31, 2020. In addition, we 
recognized a one-time gain of RMB6.4 billion (US $981 million) arising from the revaluation of our 
previously held equity interests in Sun Art upon our consolidation in the quarter ended December 31, 2020, 
compared to a one-time gain of RMB10.3 billion recogn ized in relation to our deconsolidation of AliExpress 
Russia businesses in the same quarter of 2019. 
The above-mentioned gains were excluded from our non-GAAP net income.  Other income, net 
Other income, net in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 was RMB2,826 million (US$433 million), 
compared to RMB987 million in the same quarter of 2019. The increase in other income, net was primarily due to the increase in the amount of input VAT super-c redit that can be offset against our VAT payable. 
Income tax expenses  
Income tax expenses in the quarter ended December  31, 2020 were RMB9,194 million (US$1,409 million), 
compared to RMB8,407 million in the same quarter of 2019.

  Our effective tax rate was 10% in the quarter ended December 31, 2020, compared to 15% in the same 
quarter of 2019. Excluding share-based compensation ex pense, revaluation and disposal gains/losses of

We record our share of results of all equity method inve stees one quarter in arrears. We recorded a share of 
loss of other equity method investees in the quarter ended December 31, 2020, compared to a share of profit 
of other equity method investees in the same quarter of  2019, primarily because our share of profit of Suning 
in the quarter ended December 31, 2019 included a significant one-time gain arising from Suning’s 
deconsolidation of one of its subsidiaries.  In addition, we recorded an impairment loss of RMB7,196 million (US$1,103 million) in this quarter with respect to certain equity method investees as a result of their 
prolonged decline in market values against our carrying values.   
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused widespread disruption to the economy, and the businesses of our

results of equity method investees in future periods.

cash equivalents and short-term investments during th e quarter ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due 
to free cash flow generated from operations of RMB 96,210 million (US$14,745 million), partly offset by 
cash used in investment and acquisition activi ties of RMB46,852 million (US$7,180 million). 
Cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow  
Net cash provided by operating activities in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 was RMB103,208 million 
(US$15,817 million), an increase of 7% compared to RMB96,505 million in the same quarter of 2019. Free 
cash flow, a non-GAAP measurement of  liquidity, in the quarter ende d December 31, 2020 increased by 
23% to RMB96,210 million (US$14,745 million), from RMB78,279 million in the same quarter of 2019, 
mainly due to our robust profit growth. A reconciliati on of net cash provided by operating activities to free 
cash flow is included at the end of this results announcement. 
Net cash used in investing activities  
During the quarter ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in investing activities of RMB79,712 million 
(US$12,216 million) primarily reflected (i) cash out flow of RMB46,852 million (US$7,180 million) for 
investment and acquisition activities, including the acquisi tion of Sun Art, (ii) an increase in short-term 
investments by RMB28,433 million (US$4,358 million), as well as (iii) capital expenditures of RMB5,844 
million (US$895 million) , which included cash outflow for acquisition of land use rights and construction in 
progress relating to office campuses  of RMB975 million (US$149 million).

  We adopted ASU 2019-02, “Entertainment — Films — Other Assets — Film Costs (Subtopic 926-20) and 
Entertainment — Broadcasters — Intangibles — Goodwill and Other (Subtopic 920-350),” on April 1, 
2020. As a result of our adoption of this new accoun ting update, we are now reporting cash outflows for the 
acquisition of licensed copyrights as operating activi ties in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
prospectively beginning on April 1, 2020. Prior to our adoption of ASU 2019-02, cash outflows for the 
acquisition of licensed copyrights were previously cla ssified as investing activities in the consolidated 
statements of cash flows. 
Employees  
As of December 31, 2020, we had a total of 252,084 employees, compared to 122,399 as of September 30, 
2020.  The increase was primarily due to the consolidation of Sun Art.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  
To supplement our consolidated fina ncial statements, which are prepared  and presented in accordance with 
GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measur es: for our consolidated results, adjusted EBITDA 
(including adjusted EBITDA margin), adjusted EBIT A (including adjusted EBITA margin), marketplace-
based core commerce adjusted EBITA, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share/ADS 
and free cash flow. For more information on these non-G AAP financial measures, please refer to the section 
entitled “Information about Segments” and the table ca ptioned “Reconciliations of  Non-GAAP Measures to 
the Nearest Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures” in this results announcement. 
 
We believe that adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITA,  marketplace-based core commerce adjusted EBITA, 
non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share/ADS help identify underlying trends in 
our business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of certain income or expenses that we include in 
income from operations, net income and diluted earni ngs per share/ADS. We believe that these non-GAAP 
measures provide useful information about our core operating results, enhance the overall understanding of 
our past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used 
by our management in its financial and operational decision-making. We present three different income 
measures, namely adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBIT A and non-GAAP net income, as well as one measure 
that provides supplemental information on our core commerce segment, namely marketplace-based core 
commerce adjusted EBITA, in order to provide more  information and greater transparency to investors 
about our operating results.  
 We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides us eful information to management and 
investors about the amount of cash generated by our business that can be used for strategic corporate 
transactions, including investing in our new busin ess initiatives, making strategic investments and 
acquisitions and strengthening our balance sheet. 
 Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITA, marketplace- based core commerce adjusted EBITA, non-GAAP net 
income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share/ADS and fr ee cash flow should not be considered in isolation 
or construed as an alternative to income from operations, adjusted EBITA for core commerce, net income, 
 
 
 
21 
 
  diluted earnings per share/ADS, cash flows or any othe r measure of performance or as an indicator of our 
operating performance. These non-GAAP financial meas ures presented here do not have standardized 
meanings prescribed by U.S. GAAP and may not be co mparable to similarly titled measures presented by 
other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their 
usefulness as comparative measures to our data. 
 
Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before (i) interest and investment income, net, interest expense, 
other income, net, income tax expenses and share of results of equity method investees, (ii) certain non-cash 
expenses, consisting of share-based compensation expense,  amortization of intangible assets, depreciation of 
property and equipment, operating lease cost relating to land use rights and impairment of goodwill, which 
we do not believe are reflective of our core operating performance during the periods presented.  
Adjusted EBITA  represents net income before (i) interest an d investment income, net, interest expense, 
other income, net, income tax expenses and share of results of equity method investees, (ii) certain non-cash 
expenses, consisting of share-based compensation expense,  amortization of intangible assets and impairment 
of goodwill, which we do not believe are reflective of  our core operating performance during the periods 
presented. 
Marketplace-based core commerce adjusted EBITA  represents adjusted EBITA for core commerce 
excluding the effects of (i) local consumer services, ( ii) Lazada, (iii) New Retail and direct import and (iv) 
Cainiao Network. Marketplace-based core commerce adjusted EBITA reflects the performance of our most established businesses, namely, those of our China retail marketplaces and wholesale marketplaces which 
primarily adopt a marketplace-based approach. By exclud ing certain businesses that are in the earlier stages 
of their development and with business approaches that continue to evolve, marketplace-based core 
commerce adjusted EBITA enables investors to clearly evaluate the performance of our most established 
businesses on a like-for-like basis.
 
 
Non-GAAP net income represents net income before share-based compensation expense, amortization of 
intangible assets, impairment of investments and goodwill, gain or loss on deemed 
disposals/disposals/revaluation of investments, gain in relation to the receipt of the 33% equity interest in 
Ant Group, amortization of excess value receivable arising from the restructuring of commercial arrangements with Ant Group and others, as adjust ed for the tax effects on non-GAAP adjustments.
 
 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share represents non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary 
shareholders divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the periods on a diluted 
basis. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS represents non-GAAP diluted earnings per share after 
adjustment to the ordinary share-to-ADS ratio. 
 
Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities as presented in our consolidated cash 
flow statement less purchases of property and e quipment (excluding acquisition of land use rights and 
construction in progress relating to office campuses) a nd other intangible assets, as well as adjustments to 
exclude from net cash provided by operating acti vities the consumer protection fund deposits from 
merchants on our China retail marketplaces. Prior to April 1, 2020, we also deducted acquisition of licensed 
copyrights from cash flows from investing activities. After our adoption of ASU 2019-02, “Entertainment — 
Films — Other Assets — Film Costs (Subtopic 926-20) and Entertainment — Broadcasters — Intangibles 
— Goodwill and Other (Subtopic 920-350),” on April 1, 2020, we changed the classification of cash 
outflows for the acquisition of licensed copyrights from in vesting activities to operating activities in the 
consolidated statements of cash flows, prospectively be ginning on April 1, 2020. We deduct certain items of 
cash flows from investing activities in order to pr ovide greater transparency into cash flow from our 
revenue-generating business operations. We exclude “ac quisition of land use rights and construction in 
progress relating to office campuses” because the office campuses are used by us for corporate and 
administrative purposes and are not directly related to our revenue-generating business operations. We also 
 
 
 
22 
 
  exclude consumer protection fund deposits from merchant s on our China retail marketplaces because these 
deposits are restricted for the purpose of compensating consumers for claims against merchants. 
 
The section entitled “Information about Segments” a nd the table captioned “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP 
Measures to the Nearest Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures” in this results announcement have more details 
on the non-GAAP financial measures that are most direc tly comparable to GAAP financial measures and the 
related reconciliations between these financial measures.
